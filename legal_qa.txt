user: We are all paid differently even if we do the same work. Some men get more than us women. Is that right?

You can report the issue to the Pollution Control Board, municipal commissioner, and also your local MLA. Take photos or videos. If ignored, go to the National Green Tribunal. You deserve clean air and protection from harm.

user: We don’t get regular garbage pickup like richer areas do. Is that fair?
bot: That is unfair and also against the rules. Under the Solid Waste Management Rules, every area—rich or poor—must get equal waste collection services. If your area is being ignored, file a complaint with the municipality or health officer. Gather others from your community and complain together. Everyone has the same legal right to cleanliness.

user: Sometimes we have no food for days. Is there any law that says we must get help with food?
bot: Yes. The law recognizes food as a basic human right. This means every person must have access to enough, safe, and nutritious food. If you're hungry, you can ask local government offices or councillors for help. They must support you through food aid programs. No one should starve when the law protects your right to eat.

user: Our crops failed because of drought. Can the government help us get seeds and support?
bot: Yes, the law says the government must protect people during natural disasters like droughts. You can ask for support such as seeds, farming tools, or emergency food. Go to your ward councillor or agricultural extension officer. This is your legal right under food security and disaster response policies.

user: We see large land near us lying unused. Can we ask to use it to grow food?
bot: Yes, you can. The law encourages fair access to land, especially for poor and vulnerable people. If land is idle and not in use, you can write to your rural district council or land board and request permission to farm it. This is part of ensuring food for all. You have the right to ask.

user: I’m a woman and I want to farm, but land is given only to men in my area. Is that legal?
bot: No, it’s not. The law says women have equal rights to land. Denying land because you are a woman is discrimination, which is against the law. You can report this to the local council or legal aid office. You deserve the same chance to farm and feed your family.

user: We don’t know what to plant with changing weather. Can we get advice from anyone?
bot: Yes. The government must provide agricultural training and climate information to small farmers. You can visit the agricultural extension office or ask your local councillor to connect you. It's your right to get this knowledge to grow food better, even with climate change.

user: Our village is far from markets. We grow food but can’t sell it easily. What can we do?
bot: The law says farmers must have access to markets and roads. You can ask local government to improve roads or transport so you can sell your food. Bring this up in ward meetings. If you’re blocked from markets, your food security is at risk—and the law says that must be fixed.

user: Our maize was destroyed by pests. Can we get help to recover?
bot: Yes. Food laws require government support when crops fail due to pests or disease. Go to your agriculture office and report it. You may get seeds, pesticides, or other help. Don't suffer in silence—support must be given when food production is harmed.

user: I’m disabled and can’t work on the fields. How can I get food?
bot: The law protects vulnerable groups like persons with disabilities. You can apply for food aid or social protection programs through your local council. This is your right, and no one should deny you food because you cannot work. The government must help you live with dignity.

user: The food we buy in shops is often expired or fake. What does the law say?

user: Our kids are hungry at school. Can they get food there?
bot: Yes. Schools are supposed to have feeding programs, especially in poor areas. The law supports this to help children learn better. Ask the school head or local education office about the school feeding scheme. If it’s not running, demand it—your children deserve food and education.

user: We don’t have money to buy fertilizer or equipment. Can we get help?
bot: Yes. The government has agricultural support programs for small-scale and poor farmers. You can apply for help through the local agricultural office. The law says you must be supported to grow food—lack of money should not stop you from farming.

user: The local shop sells food at very high prices. What can we do?
bot: The law stops unfair pricing and hoarding. You can report price abuse to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or local authorities. Everyone should afford food, especially the poor. Keep receipts and file a complaint—don’t let shops cheat you.

user: Our family lost crops and animals due to floods. Can we ask for food aid?
bot: Yes, absolutely. The law says when disasters like floods hit, the government must give emergency food and help people recover. Go to your councillor or district office. This isn’t charity—it’s your legal right to be protected during disaster.

user: We don’t know who to ask about food aid. How do we get help?

user: I’m part of a small farming group. Can we get support together?
bot: Yes. If you’re in a cooperative or farming group, you can apply together for land, seeds, or training. The law encourages community-based food production. Go to your local agriculture or rural development office. Working as a group gives you more power—use your voice to claim your rights.


user: I work as a daily wage laborer. My daughter wants to study in a big government college. Can she get help to get in?
bot: Yes. If you belong to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), or Other Backward Class (OBC), your daughter has a legal right to reserved seats in central government colleges. These laws help children from poor and backward families get better chances. Apply under the reservation quota and submit your caste certificate with the application.

user: We belong to a tribal community, and my son wants to do medicine. But we can’t afford donation seats. What should we do?
bot: You don’t need to pay donation for reserved seats. 7.5% of seats are kept aside for ST students in central medical colleges. Apply under that quota and attach your tribal certificate. You can also apply for scholarships. These rights are protected by law—no college can deny them.

user: My child scored well but didn’t get into a government college. Others with money did. What can I do?
bot: If your child belongs to SC, ST, or OBC, check if reserved seats were given properly. Colleges must follow reservation laws. Ask for the admission list under RTI (Right to Information). If there’s unfairness, complain to the college and also approach the education department or a legal aid center.

user: I’m a poor OBC farmer. Can my child get a seat in a good central university without high fees?
bot: Yes. 27% of seats are reserved for OBC students. Plus, many central universities offer financial aid, hostel facilities, and scholarships. These are meant to support students from families like yours. Make sure you have the OBC certificate and apply under the reserved category during admissions.

user: We can’t afford private schools. Are there any central schools that help poor families like us?
bot: Yes, Kendriya Vidyalayas and central universities have quotas for SC, ST, and OBC students. These schools and colleges follow government rules to give chances to students from weaker sections. They also offer low fees, free books, and meals in some cases. Check nearby institutions and apply early.

user: My daughter was told that all seats were full, but others got in later. We are SC. Is this allowed?
bot: No, it’s not allowed. 15% of seats are reserved for SC students in central institutions. If the college skipped your daughter’s turn or gave the seat to someone else, you have the right to complain. Ask for the selection list, and if needed, file a complaint with the education department or SC Commission.

user: I didn’t study much, but I want my son to have a better life. How do I use reservation benefits?
bot: First, get a valid caste certificate if you are SC, ST, or OBC. During college admission, select the reserved category option. Your son will compete only with others from the same group, improving his chances. Also look for scholarships and coaching programs for reserved category students.

user: We live in a slum. My child faces discrimination in school. Will college be the same?
bot: Discrimination is illegal. In colleges, laws like this one ensure fair chances for SC, ST, and OBC students. Institutions must treat all students equally. If your child faces bias, report it to the college’s grievance cell or education board. Your child has the right to study with dignity and respect.

user: My son wants to study science, but the form is confusing. What should we select for reserved category?
bot: If you’re SC, ST, or OBC, you must select your correct category during online or offline admission. Attach the caste certificate. If you’re unsure, ask someone at the helpdesk or a government education center. Filling it correctly ensures your child gets their legal reservation seat.

user: I heard that reservations don’t apply in top colleges. Is that true?
bot: That’s false. All central government colleges—including IITs, NITs, and central universities—must follow reservation rules. These include 15% for SC, 7.5% for ST, and 27% for OBC (non-creamy layer). If a college is not following this, it’s breaking the law. Report them to the education department or legal aid.

user: My neighbor says reservation seats are only for city people. Is that true?
bot: Not true at all. Reservation is for all eligible SC, ST, and OBC students—whether you live in a village, slum, or city. If you have the correct certificate, your child has a right to apply. Many students from rural areas have gone to top colleges using this law.

user: I applied under SC but got rejected. How can I find out why?
bot: Ask the college for a written reason. You can also file an RTI (Right to Information) request to see how seats were filled. If your application was correct and you were unfairly denied, complain to the education board or seek free legal help. Colleges must follow reservation rules properly.

user: We’re poor and live in a rented house. Can we get any help beyond just reservation?
bot: Yes. Many central institutions offer free hostels, scholarships, books, and meal support for SC, ST, and OBC students. These programs help children from low-income homes complete their studies without dropping out. Ask the college office about all the facilities available when your child joins.

user: My daughter studies well but is shy. Can reservation really help her succeed?
bot: Yes. Reservation opens the door, but success comes from effort. Many reserved category students from poor homes have become doctors, engineers, and teachers. Colleges must also support students with mentoring and guidance. Encourage your daughter—she has every right to dream big and succeed.

user: My husband drinks and beats me often. Is there any protection for me under this law?
bot: Yes. If your husband is abusive, you can file for separation or divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act. Cruelty is a legal reason to leave the marriage. You also have protection under the Domestic Violence Act. Visit a police station, women’s help center, or Legal Aid office. You deserve safety and respect—don’t stay silent.

user: My daughter is just 15. Can I get her married if we can’t afford to raise her?
bot: No, child marriage is illegal. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, girls must be at least 18 to marry. Forcing or allowing a child to marry can lead to jail or fines. Instead, seek help from government welfare schemes that support girls’ education and health. Her safety and future are protected by law.

user: My husband left me 2 years ago and hasn’t returned. Can I get a divorce?
bot: Yes. If your husband has left you without reason for 2 or more years, you can file for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act. You’ll need to go to a family court. Legal aid services offer free help to those who can’t afford lawyers. You don’t have to live in uncertainty forever.

user: My wife can’t have children. Can I marry another woman?
bot: No, not unless you get a legal divorce first. Having another wife while the first is still alive and married to you is a crime under the law. Infertility is not a valid reason to remarry illegally. You can talk to your partner or go for counseling. Adoption is also an option.

user: We are married by rituals but never registered it. Is our marriage legal?
bot: Yes, if proper Hindu customs were followed (like pheras or mangalsutra), your marriage is valid under the law. But it’s better to register the marriage officially. It helps in getting ration cards, pensions, or inheritance. Go to your nearest sub-registrar office with documents and witnesses to register.

user: My husband remarried without divorcing me. What can I do?
bot: That is illegal. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, second marriage without divorce is a punishable offence. You can file a police complaint and also apply for divorce and maintenance. You have the right to live with dignity and get financial support. Go to a family court or women’s help desk for assistance.

user: I want to marry someone from a different caste. Can we marry legally?
bot: Yes, caste doesn’t matter under the Hindu Marriage Act. If both are Hindus (including Buddhists, Jains, or Sikhs), you can marry legally.

user: My wife left me and is living with someone else. Can I remarry?
bot: No, not unless you get a legal divorce. Living separately does not mean you're divorced. You must go to court and get a divorce order first. Remarrying before that is illegal and punishable. Even if she’s unfaithful, the law gives you a proper way to end the marriage.

user: I don’t love my husband. Can I leave him even if he doesn’t agree?
bot: Yes, you can file for divorce even without his consent. The Hindu Marriage Act allows divorce for cruelty, desertion, and other reasons. You’ll need to prove your case in court. You don’t have to live unhappily. Get help from legal aid or a women's NGO—they will guide you.

user: My parents fixed my marriage without asking me. Can they force me?
bot: No, marriage must happen with your consent. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, both the bride and groom must agree freely. If you're being forced, you can say no or even go to the police. Forced marriage is not valid in law. You have the right to choose your life partner.

user: I don’t have money for court or lawyers. Can I still get justice?

user: I lost my job during COVID and can’t pay my loans. What will happen now?
bot: If you can't repay loans, the law gives you a way out. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, helps people like you settle debts legally. You can approach a legal aid center and apply for insolvency. This stops banks or moneylenders from harassing you. Courts will help plan how to repay or forgive your debt based on your situation.

user: A recovery agent came home and shouted in front of my neighbors. Is that legal?
bot: No, recovery agents can’t threaten, humiliate, or shame you. That’s against your rights. Under the IBC and RBI rules, they must follow a code of conduct. If they misbehave, file a complaint with the bank and the police. Legal aid centers can help you take action. You're protected from harassment.

user: I borrowed money from a bank for my small shop. Now I can't pay monthly dues. What can I do?
bot: If you’re unable to pay, you can apply for a “Fresh Start” under the IBC if your total assets and income are very low. This process may wipe out your debts. Visit a Legal Services Authority office for help. Don’t wait—delays make it worse. You have legal options to restart without fear.

user: My income is only ₹7,000 a month. I took a ₹20,000 loan, but I can’t pay it now. Will they take my home?
bot: If your income and assets are below a limit (₹5,000 income and ₹60,000 assets), you may qualify for a Fresh Start process. It can cancel your debt legally. Even if you don’t qualify, a repayment plan can protect your home. Visit a legal aid center or district court to apply. The law protects small borrowers.

user: What is insolvency? Is it only for rich businessmen?
bot: No, insolvency is not just for companies. If you can’t repay debts, you can use this law too. IBC helps both individuals and businesses. It gives a legal way to deal with unpaid loans, without fear or shame. Legal aid is free for poor citizens, so you can get help.

user: I have loans from both a bank and a moneylender. I can't pay either. What should I do?

user: Will I be jailed if I don’t pay my loan?
bot: No, you cannot be sent to jail for not repaying a civil loan. The law sees it as a financial issue, not a crime. The IBC gives you a legal path to resolve debt. But hiding income or cheating can be punished. So be open, and get legal help to apply for relief.

user: I’m scared to go to court. Is there any free help for people like me?
bot: Yes, every district has a Legal Services Authority that gives free help to low-income people. They’ll guide you in filling forms, going to court, and talking to lenders. You don’t need a private lawyer. Ask your ward office where the nearest center is. Help is your right.

user: What is the Fresh Start scheme under the IBC?
bot: Fresh Start is a special plan under the IBC for people with very low income and debt. If you earn under ₹5,000 a month and owe less than ₹35,000, your debt can be legally erased. No need to repay anything. It’s like getting a new chance to live debt-free. Legal aid centers can file this for you.

user: What if I borrowed money for my daughter’s marriage and now I can’t repay it?
bot: The law doesn’t judge why you took a loan. If you can’t repay, the IBC still applies. You can ask for a repayment plan or seek debt forgiveness. File through the court with help from legal aid. Don’t hide—act early and explain your situation clearly.

user: The bank is threatening to auction my scooter, which I need for work. Can they do that?
bot: Banks must follow legal steps to take any asset. If you apply under the IBC, all action stops until the court decides. If your scooter is your livelihood, tell the court—it may protect it. Legal help is free if you can’t afford a lawyer. Your job tools can be saved in many cases.

user: I took a group loan with neighbors. One person ran away. Now the bank is asking me to pay.
bot: In group loans, everyone is jointly responsible. But if you can’t afford it, the court under IBC can reduce or restructure your share. File an insolvency application quickly. Show income proof and talk to legal aid. The law can help if you act fast.

user: How long does the insolvency process take for people like me?
bot: For individuals, the IBC aims to settle matters within 180 days, sometimes even faster. But it depends on your case and honesty. If you qualify for the Fresh Start scheme, it can be even quicker. Courts and legal aid will help move it forward. Start early to avoid pressure from lenders.

user: Is it better to go to a moneylender or a bank?
bot: Always choose banks or government schemes. Moneylenders charge high interest and often use illegal methods to recover money. If you face trouble with them, the IBC and local police can help. Don’t suffer in silence—legal loans are safer, and your rights are protected.

user: The tap water smells bad and is yellow in color. Can we report this?

user: We have to walk far to fetch water. Isn’t this wrong?

user: We’ve not been paid for two months. Who can help us?

user: My employer locked us out of work without notice. What can we do?
bot: Lockouts are legal only with proper notice and government approval in some cases. If this wasn’t followed, it’s illegal. You can file a dispute under the Act and ask for back wages. A union can also take up the matter with authorities.

user: We are forced to sign blank papers before joining. Is this right?
bot: No, never sign blank papers. It can be misused. Demand a proper appointment letter. If forced, note down the date and people involved, and report to the Labour Officer. Signing under pressure is not legally valid.

user: The boss only gives jobs to people from his village. Isn’t that unfair?

user: I make handmade clay pots with unique designs. Can I protect my design from being copied?
bot: Yes, under the Geneva Act, your pot design can be registered internationally. This protects it from being copied in other countries. You can file through the WIPO system with help from local legal aid centers or design support organizations. It helps preserve your skills and stops others from making money off your creativity.

user: We’re poor artisans. Isn’t international registration only for big companies?
bot: No. The Geneva Act allows individuals, even from low-income backgrounds, to register designs. You don’t need to be a big company. With the help of a local NGO or patent facilitator, you can file a design application and protect your work internationally. This law supports fairness and gives small creators global protection.

user: Someone abroad is copying our embroidery designs. Can this law help?

bot: You can get help from local design support centers or legal aid groups. They can assist with the forms and communicate with the International Bureau of WIPO.

user: I have no money. Is registering my design very costly?
bot: While there is a fee, it’s cheaper than registering separately in each country. You can apply for fee reductions or ask for support through government schemes, MSME offices, or WIPO assistance. Some NGOs also help artisans pay registration fees. Don’t let money stop you from protecting your work.

user: I made a new basket design with my wife. Can we both register it together?

user: A company wants to buy my design idea. Can I still keep ownership?
bot: You can license your design—this means the company pays you to use it, but you keep ownership. The Geneva Act lets you register and then license your design legally. Always get a written agreement. NGOs or legal aid can help you write this in simple terms. Don’t sell your rights cheaply.

user: If I register my design, what do I get in return?
bot: You get exclusive rights for 5 years, renewable up to 15 years or more. This means nobody else can use your design without your permission. If they do, you can take legal action. It gives you control and helps you earn from your own work without fear of copying.

user: Can someone cancel my design registration after I get it?
bot: Yes, but only in special cases—like if your design isn’t new or doesn’t meet basic rules. But once approved, it’s hard to cancel without a strong reason. Always make sure your design is original and different. Local patent offices or design experts can help you check before applying.

user: I heard this is only for foreign markets. Can it help me sell in India too?
bot: Yes. The Geneva Act helps you register designs abroad, but it also supports Indian registrations. Once protected, you can use that registration to grow your business, stop copying, and improve your sales both locally and internationally. Many artisan products have become successful this way.

user: What if someone copies my design and sells it in their name?
bot: If your design is registered, you can take action. File a complaint through the WIPO system or contact your local legal aid cell. The registration gives you proof that the design is yours. You can stop the seller and even ask for compensation. You don’t have to stay silent.
